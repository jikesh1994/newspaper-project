<h1 class="headline">Facebook stock takes hit on FTC probe and news it records users' call logs</h1>
<h2 class="subhead">Facebook shares had declined about 2.5 percent in later-afternoon trading.</h2>
<article>
<div class="byline">Jikesh Mishra<br/><span>Energy editor</span></div>

<p>A probe by the Federal Trade Commission is the latest bad news to slam Facebook, after the agency announced Monday it was launching a nonpublic investigation into the social media giant's privacy practices.</p>

<p>"The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers," Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. "The FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook."</p>
<p>
The FTC news sent Facebook's stock price lower, adding to a sharp decline that started when a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower came forward to detail how the firm had taken Facebook data and used it to target ads for President Donald Trump's campaign.</p>

<p>There is also growing evidence that public opinion on Facebook has shifted. An Axios-commissioned Survey Monkey poll shows that the social network's favorability has declined since October by 28 points, nearly double that of all the other tech giants. The #deletefacebook hashtag has continued to flourish on social media as customers strike out against Facebook, with tech billionaire Elon Musk bringing further visibility to the movement last week when he deleted the Facebook page for two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX.

It's not clear, however, how many other users are actually taking the plunge and disconnecting themselves from the world's largest social media platform — which for some users constitutes the majority of their online experience.

There was also indication that automated bot networks were participating in amplifying the hashtag.

On Sunday Illinois became the first state to file a lawsuit against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, alleging a "fraudulent scheme to harvest the data of millions of American voters."

<p>Ahead of next week's autumn statement, the chancellor is looking to transfer the £1.6bn cost of the energy companies obligation (Eco) and the smaller warm home discount to the taxpayer, removing the burden from household bills.</p>

<p>"We need assurances from George Osborne in the autumn statement about where we stand," said a spokesman for the REA. "Nick Clegg says one thing about the green levies, Michael Fallon [the energy minister] another."</p>

<p>Last week David Cameron was reported to have talked about the need to get rid of "green crap" from energy bills. Number 10 said it did not recognise the phrase but did not deny the sentiment. Peter Atherton, a leading energy analyst, warned last week that investment in power generation was "killed stone dead" until the next election by Ed Miliband's call for a price freeze and government delays in introducing promised electricity market reform.</p>

<p>The political and public environment for power companies is set to become more hostile following the publication of figures on Monday showing that the average profit per customer for the big six rose from £30 to £53 last year. The industry watchdog said the rise was due to higher bills and increased energy use during a harsh winter, not due to cost reduction.</p>

<p>RWE indicated that the government might have to raise green subsidies - and thus increase bills or the burden on the taxpayer - after admitting that technical difficulties had pushed the price up so far that it could not be justified under the current subsidy regime.</p>

<p>"This is not a decision we have taken lightly; however, given the technological challenges and market conditions, now is not the right time for RWE to continue to progress with this project," said Paul Cowling, director of offshore wind at RWE Innogy.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Array would have provided clean energy for almost 1m homes and provided thousands of jobs in the construction phase. Cowling insisted RWE remained committed to offshore wind and would be proceeding with a range of other projects off the coast of Britain.</p>

<h1>Air India is the country's flag air carrier with a significant market position in domestic</h1>
<div class="byline">Jikesh mishra and Bibek Sahu</div> 

<p>NEW DELHI:  The central government on Wednesday invited "Expression of Interest" for the strategic divestment of national passenger carrier Air India (AI), along with the airline's shares in Air India Express (AIXL) and Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS).
</p>

<p>"The Government of India has given 'in-principle' approval for the strategic disinvestment of AI by way of the transfer of management control and sale of 76 per cent equity share capital of AI held by GOI, which will include AI's shareholding interest in the AIXL and AISATS," said the Preliminary Information Memorandum document.</p>

<p>His 67-year-old wife, Chanda, was part of the same grouping, which set itself up in 1976 in a library-cum-commune inside a large Victorian building in Brixton, south London, with about 25 members. Its leader, Balakrishnan, was known at the time as Comrade Bala.</p>

<p>Steve Rayner, an academic who studied the group, noted its cultlike attributes, in which there was little debate and the few members with jobs donated all their income to the organisation. Rayner, a professor at Oxford University, who studied Balakrishnan's group for a 1979 PhD thesis on leftwing groups, described the leader's "superior ability to manipulate" other members, who were mainly from overseas and appeared vulnerable.</p>

<p>Rayner's investigation found that members, who wore Mao badges at all times, believed that they and the rest of Brixton would soon be liberated by the Red Army. He said the group was the "clearest case of far-left millenarianism which I have encountered".</p>

<p>The couple were both arrested on suspicion of holding three women captive at a series of addresses in south London including, most recently, a council-owned flat in Peckford Place, Brixton. Police inquiries have since tied the group to more than a dozen properties around south London over the decades.</p>
<p>Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, named for the first time on Monday, was a senior member of the tiny Communist party of England (Marxist-Leninist) in the early 1970s, before splitting away in 1974 to form an even more niche and hardline grouping, the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.</p>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>am satisfied that the sanctions in this case properly reflect a balance between the need to protect the integrity and reputation of the game and the need to maintain the possibility of redemption for the individuals involved, all of whom have learned difficult lessons through these events," he added.</p>

<p>"These are significant penalties for professional players and the Board does not impose them lightly. It is hoped that following a period of suspension, the players will be able to return to playing the game they love and eventually rebuild their careers," he said.</p>

<p>After the incident, the Australian media came out all guns blazing against the cricketers and slammed them for bringing disgrace and humiliation to the country.

Sutherland had already asked Smith and Warner to step down as captain and vice-captain respectively after the former admitted that Australia's 'leadership group' orchestrated the plan.

Smith was handed full-time captaincy of the Australian cricket team after the team lost the Ashes 2-3 to England under the leadership of Michael Clarke. </p>
